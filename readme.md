# Implementing Languages

## Slides

You can find the slides, for this workshop, at <https://speakerdeck.com/chrispitt/implementing-languages-fluentconf>.

## Running

Install Babel compiler (to make ES6 work!):

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev babel-cli
```

Then, run each script to see output:

```sh
$ babel-node lexer.js
```

Alternatively, you can run this code in <https://jsbin.com/> after setting the JavaScript dropdown to "ES6 / Babel".
